    <h3><b>1. Wrist catch & finger pull</b></h3>
    <p>One method to avoid harasment or an attack is by catching the wrist of your attacker. When your attacker is getting handsy 
    then this is one of the best ways to get him on the ground</p>
    <p>With one hand grab the ring and little finger, with the other grab the middle and index fingers and pull both hands 
    in opposite directions while bending the wrist away from yourself</p>
    <h3><b>2. Adams Apple</b></b></h3>
    <p>When it isnt possible to catch the wrist of your attacker then another way to temporarily disorient him is by punching his adams apple 
    or by hiting him with you finger at his adams apple and colar bones.</p>

    <h3><b>3. Front Grab</b></h3>
    <p>If your attacker grabs you from your front disallowing you to use your hands then in this situation first make a fist 
    in front of your pelvis. This move allows some room between you and the attacker. Then using your forehead hit the attackers nose.
    This will make him pull away from you, giving you the chance to hit him in the groin with your knee. 
    </p>

    <p>Incase there is still
    some distance between you and the attacker then you can further disable the attacker by straightening your left arm and using you
    right arm hiiting the attacker in his chin and nose with your palm and then kicking him in the groin.</p>

    <h3><b>4. Side Grab</b></h3>
    <p>If your attacker approaches you from your side then using an arched move you can hit the attackers jaw,temple or nose.
    This will cause the attacker to go back a few steps allowing you room to ellbow him in the belly or chest.</p>
    <p>This will disorient the attcker and buy you some time to escape.</p>

   <h3><b>4. Side Grab</b></h3>
   <p>In the scenario that your attacker grabs you from behind quickly bend back and try to hit the attcker with the back of your head.
    The objective is to get the attacker to move his leg forward. Once he does quickly bend down and pull it up. This will cause him to lose balance and 
    fall down.</p>

    <h3><b>5. Pushed aginst the wall</b></h3>
    <p>If your attacker pushes you against the wall then in this situation you should hit whatever vulnerable area you are able to reach.
    If the attacker has his hands above your neck then the armpit is an easier target. Else if he has his hands lower you can reach for the 
    chest,neck or jaw areas. The most affective way however is hitting him with your head. Squat a little and then jump up and hit him in the jaw with your head.
