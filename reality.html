      <h1>Gender pay gap and Abused work place</h1>
      <p>Workplace mistreatment?Lesser pays to different gender? One would think that such occurrences wouldn't happen in this time of day but unfortunately that is not the case. Despite the Tittle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibiting such behavior sexual harassment in the workplace still proves to be pervasive.</p>
<p>This king of imbalance in the workplace poses a danger to women and expecially women that also undergo other kinds of discrimination like LGBTQ+, women of color, etc.</p>
<p>Due to this not only are the women affected mentally but it also reflects in their work, advancement,and earnings. Due to fear some woman chose not to speak up when they are being sexually harased and the ones that do chose to brave up and make a stand often dont get an effective response.</p>
<p>Woman who are victims to sexual harasment report to fall into a state of depression and anxiety and when such situations are not addressed properly they can feel discouraged and less empowered.</p>
<p>Women who experience workplace harassment are said to be 6.5 times more prone to changing jobs according to a recent study. These jobs are often lower paying or lower quality jobs. This can increase occupational gender segregation and hostile work environments that again cause the same thing.</p>
<p>It has also been noted that women who experience workplace sexual harasment are also prone to taking more frequent pay cuts to escape from the ill treatment. This results in financial stress and imbalance which could lead to severe health concerns.</p>
<p>This just get a whole lot worse for women facing not one but two kinds of discrmination like a woman of colour or a woman part of the LGBTQ+ community.</br> Due to these reasons women are shunned out of industries and workspaces and are forced to  accept such unfair treatment.</p>
