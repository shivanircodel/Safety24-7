# Safety24-7
# ðŸ”¥ Inspiration:
Our concern and responsibility towards women in our society made us do this wonderful project named Womenlance! Joshita, Ajay Kumar, Shivani and Paavani decided to contribute our part and find an amazing solution to few of the problems faced by women every day around the globe.

# ðŸ¤© What it does:
Womenlance provides a solution to most of the problems they face today. It provides all the necessary self-defense techniques in the time of emergency and making them physically strong, it also supports women through it's mental health section and makes them mentally strong. Womenlance also provides information and access to various important applications which can prove to save lives in the time of danger ! It also makes the users aware of the gender pay gap and abuse at workplace and few of its solutions.

# ðŸ¤” How we built, Challenges we faced & ðŸ˜Ž Accomplishments that we're proud of!
Womenlance has been built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. We faced many errors while deploying the website and we were successful in resolving them. We are proud of the fact that we could successfully complete our project Womenlance by implementing our idea in such a short span of time as this was the first hackathon for some of us through strong dedication.

# ðŸ˜€ What's next for Womenlance:
As the security for women and gender discrimination in every field is a very important topic today, we would like to make Womenlance more user friendly and add more useful and creative features in the coming days.
